				<td colspan='1' style='text-align:left;'> The aim of this online lab is to correctly name up to 19 different molecules. Once you have selected a particular molecule (which you can do at any time) it's diagram will be displayed in the top right of the display area.<ul> <li>Identify the functional group.</li> <li>Locate the longest carbon chain in the compound and name it.</li> <ul> <li>Note: A functional groups is always part of the parent chain.</li> </ul> <li>Check if there is one or more double or triple bond(s) in your parent chain and name them.</li> <li>Add the suffix of the functional group.</li> <li>Check if you need to define the position of the functional groups and/or a bond and/or a side chain.<li> <ul> <li>Note: The numbers that define the positions of the principal functional group and substituents are called locants. The locants are assigned such that the principal functional group gets the lowest possible locant.</li> </ul> <li>If the compound contains a functional group and a triple or double bond, the locant of the bond is added before the name of the compound while the locant of the functional groups is added before the suffix of the name (third part of the name). If there is no double or triple bond, the locant for the functional group goes before the name of the main parent chain.</li> <li>Acids and aldehydes are always on the first carbon of the parent chain so there is no need for numbering.</li> </ul></td>
